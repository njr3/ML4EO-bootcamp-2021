# Lecture 10 - Tropical Cyclone Wind Estimation from Satellite Imagery

In this lecture, we will use satellite imagery of tropical cyclones to estimate their wind speed. This is a regression problem (i.e. estimating a continuous variable from input imagery) and we will use a CNN architecture for it. 

To check out a summary of the methodology presented here and results, please visit [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/deep-learning-computer-vision-satellite-imagery-ali-ahmadalipour/).

The dataset was developed for a [data science competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/72/predict-wind-speeds/), and you can read more about the it on [Radiant MLHub](http://registry.mlhub.earth/10.34911/rdnt.xs53up/).
