# Lecture 6 - A Hands-on Training for Machine Learning in Python
### Image Classification of Drone Imagery

In this course you will use a training dataset from Radiant MLHub repository with drone imagery of crops in Rwanda, and build a classification model to identify the crop type of each image. 

To learn more about the dataset, checkout its [registry page](http://registry.mlhub.earth/10.34911/rdnt.r4p1fr/) on Radiant MLHub.

## Homework

After this lecture, you are encouraged to work on two other image classification datasets available on Radiant MLHub. 
1) [SEN12-FLOOD](http://registry.mlhub.earth/10.21227/w6xz-s898/): This dataset contains imagery of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites with labels for presence of flood in the imagery.

2) [BigEarthNet](http://registry.mlhub.earth/10.14279/depositonce-10149/): This is a land cover classification dataset, and it contains ~570,000 images with multiclass labels for each image. This is a very large dataset, and if you are running it on a local computer, you may need to select a subset of the data for training.
