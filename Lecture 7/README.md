# Lecture 7 - An Introduction to Machine Learning with Digital Earth Africa

## Overview

There are four sections to this seminar, which are listed in order below:

1. **Introduction to the Digital Earth Africa** program, platforms, and services.

2. **ML Use Case:** Building a continental cropland extent mask for Africa using supervised ML

3. **Showcase:** Introduce a notebook series exploring supervised learning in the Open Data Cube

4. **Exercise:** Run a simple supervised ML model to classify urban areas in Kenya

## Homework

After this lecture, you are encouraged to work through the `Scalable Machine Learning on the Open-Data-Cube` notebook series
1) Sign into [DE Africa's Sandbox](https://sandbox.digitalearth.africa/)

2) Follow the [instructions on using git](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki/Guide-to-working-with-your-own-copy-of-the-DE-Africa-Notebooks) to work with your own copy of the DE Africa notebooks.  

3) Within your own copy of the DE Africa notebooks repo, navigate to the [Scalable ML on the ODC](https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/tree/master/Real_world_examples/Scalable_machine_learning) notebooks series and systematically work your way through the notebooks, starting with `0_README.ipynb`. Each notebook contains extensive markdown explaining the different python functions and machine learning concepts used.
